# Metis_Regression

This second project from my Metis Data Science Bootcamp involved scraping data from a website and building linear regression models. The requirements were:
- A target that was a continuous, numerical variable
- ≥1,000 data points
- ≥10 features

I chose to explore features associated with NFL player salaries. I scraped data from pro-football-reference.com and then created/tested OLS, polynomial, ridge, and Lasso regressions. 

The project uses BeautifulSoup for the webscraping, SKlearn for the model creation/testing, Pandas/Numpy for general feature engineering, and Matplotlib, Seaborn, and SciPy for data/model visualizations. 

The finalized documents include:
- A Jupyter Notebook for the minimum viable product (MVP) assignment
- Jupyter Notebooks with the code for the project (scraping, cleaning, analysis)
- A brief writeup
- A short (5min) presentation of the project findings
